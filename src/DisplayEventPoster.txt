    In addition to all information about the event this component will also show the user an RSVP form they can fill out if they choose to
    The RSVP form will be displayed by calling the RSVPForm function

    The react component that this function returns will be populated with different data depending on the props 
    passed into it. This component is very modular but we will only display one of them to the user at a time
